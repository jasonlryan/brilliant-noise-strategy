# BN Trust OS - Data Anonymisation and Governance Policy

## Overview

This policy defines how BN Trust OS handles, processes, and anonymizes client data to enable industry benchmarking while protecting client confidentiality and complying with privacy regulations.

## Data Governance Framework

### Event-Sourced Audit Log
**Architecture:** All system events are captured in an immutable, append-only audit log
- **Timestamp Precision:** Microsecond accuracy with UTC standardization
- **Event Integrity:** Cryptographic hashing to prevent tampering
- **Retention Period:** 7 years for audit compliance, 3 years for benchmark data
- **Access Control:** Role-based access with detailed logging of all queries

### Per-Tenant Data Segregation
**Isolation Standards:**
- **Database Level:** Separate schemas per client organization
- **Application Level:** Row-level security with tenant context enforcement
- **Backup Isolation:** Client data backed up separately with independent encryption keys
- **Access Controls:** No cross-tenant data access without explicit permission

### Data Classification

#### Tier 1: Highly Sensitive Data
**Examples:** Client names, user personal information, proprietary business strategies
**Handling:** Never included in benchmarks, encrypted with client-specific keys
**Access:** Restricted to designated client success team members only
**Retention:** Deleted within 30 days of contract termination

#### Tier 2: Operationally Sensitive Data  
**Examples:** Specific campaign details, individual approval decisions, custom workflows
**Handling:** Anonymized before inclusion in any aggregate analysis
**Access:** Available to product and analytics teams for service improvement
**Retention:** Anonymized version retained for product development

#### Tier 3: Statistical Data
**Examples:** Coverage percentages, approval timing, exception rates
**Handling:** Aggregated and anonymized for benchmarking
**Access:** Used for industry analysis and benchmark reports
**Retention:** Indefinite retention in anonymized form

## Anonymisation Pipeline

### Stage 1: Direct Identifier Removal
**Automated Processing:**
```
- Client organization names → Generic identifiers (ORG_001, ORG_002)
- User names and emails → Hashed user IDs
- IP addresses → Geographical region codes  
- Project/campaign names → Generic references (PROJ_A, PROJ_B)
- Custom field values → Standardized categories
```

**Quality Assurance:** 
- Manual review of 10% of anonymized records
- Automated scanning for remaining personal identifiers
- Third-party privacy assessment annually

### Stage 2: Statistical Disclosure Control
**k-Anonymity Implementation:**
- Minimum group size of 5 for all reported segments
- Suppression of cells with counts < 5
- Generalization of attributes to ensure anonymity

**l-Diversity Standards:**
- Sensitive attributes (compliance status, exception types) must have diverse values
- Minimum of 3 different values per anonymity group
- Protection against attribute-based inference attacks

**t-Closeness Requirements:**
- Distribution of sensitive attributes within anonymity groups
- Must closely match distribution in overall dataset
- Prevents skewness-based identification

### Stage 3: Noise Injection and Perturbation
**Differential Privacy:**
- Mathematical privacy guarantee with ε ≤ 1.0 (strong privacy)
- Random noise addition to aggregate statistics
- Calibrated to maintain statistical utility while protecting individuals

**Data Perturbation:**
- Small random adjustments to timestamps (±2 hours)
- Rounding of precise measurements to broader categories
- Geographic generalization (city → region → country)

## Anonymisation Quality Assurance

### Automated Validation
**Daily Checks:**
- Scan for any remaining direct identifiers
- Validate k-anonymity requirements across all data cuts
- Check differential privacy budget consumption
- Verify data utility preservation within acceptable thresholds

**Monthly Audits:**
- Statistical analysis of anonymization effectiveness
- Re-identification risk assessment using latest techniques
- Comparison of anonymized vs. raw data utility
- Performance benchmarking of anonymization pipeline

### External Validation
**Annual Privacy Assessment:**
- Independent third-party privacy expert review
- Attempted re-identification testing with synthetic attacker models
- Compliance verification with evolving privacy regulations
- Benchmarking against industry anonymization standards

**Academic Collaboration:**
- Partnership with university privacy research teams
- Contribution to anonymization research and best practices
- Peer review of anonymization methodologies
- Publication of privacy-preserving techniques (without client data)

## Benchmark Data Usage Framework

### Opt-In Consent Process
**Initial Consent:**
- Explicit client agreement to participate in benchmarking program
- Clear explanation of data usage and anonymization process
- Option to specify exclusions or restrictions
- Ability to withdraw consent with 30-day notice

**Ongoing Consent Management:**
- Annual consent review and renewal process
- Notification of any changes to anonymization methods
- Right to review anonymized data before inclusion in benchmarks
- Granular control over which metrics participate in benchmarking

### Data Contribution Standards
**Minimum Participation Requirements:**
- 90 days of historical data for baseline establishment
- Minimum 10 initiatives per month for statistical significance

- Regular data quality validation and correction

**Data Quality Gates:**
- Automated validation of data completeness (>95% complete records)
- Outlier detection and manual review process
- Cross-validation against client-reported metrics
- Regular calibration sessions with client stakeholders

### Benchmark Publication Guidelines

#### Client Position Reports (Private)
**Individual Client Reports:**
- Client's performance vs. anonymized industry benchmarks
- Percentile rankings across key metrics
- Trend analysis and performance indicators
- Customized insights based on client's industry and size

**Privacy Protection:**
- No indication of other specific participants
- Aggregate benchmark data only (minimum 10 organizations)
- Confidence intervals to indicate statistical reliability
- Clear labeling of data sources and methodology

#### Industry Benchmark Reports (Public)
**Quarterly Reports:**

- Statistical summaries with appropriate uncertainty bounds
- Best practice insights derived from anonymized case studies
- Regulatory and market trend analysis
