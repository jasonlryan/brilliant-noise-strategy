A) The package: “BN Trust OS”

Positioning (external one‑liner):
BN Trust OS is the governance spine for AI‑assisted communications—combining a SaaS platform (Radar), a proven transformation method (Literacy Ladder + Play Cards), and benchmark data for boards.

Bill of materials (what’s in the box):

Product (SaaS): AI Risk & Trust Radar

Core: inventory → assessments → approvals → audit bundles → exceptions.

Adapters: CSV/webhooks for owned/earned signals, QBR export.

Modules: EU AI‑Act Checklist; Quarterly Expert Review.

Method (Consulting IP): BN Literacy Ladder + Play Cards

Literacy Ladder (L0→L1→L2 Tool‑maker) with 12‑week sprint + Personal AI Scorecard.

Play Cards that map the Influencer Heat Map tiles to literacy & governance gates, roles, KPIs, and steps.

Data (Benchmark IP): BN Comms Governance Benchmarks

Anonymised metrics: coverage %, TTFA, exception rates, approval SLAs, incident patterns.

Published as board‑grade reports (quarterly + annual “State of AI Governance in Comms”).

Enablement (Repeatable Services)

Founding Member Council, onboarding sprints, QBRs, Executive Board Pack, Agency Enablement Kit.

Trust Pack (Assurance/IP/Security assets)

SOC 2 artifacts, DPAs/sub‑processors, IP register, SBOM/OSS licenses, model cards & DPIAs.

Commercial Tiers (how you sell it):

Assess (£3–5k/mo): Radar core + L1 Play Cards + QBR export.

Assure (£8–12k/mo): + exceptions, SSO, adapters, L2 Play Cards, first benchmark cut.

Assure+ (custom): multi‑entity, L3 pilots, Quarterly Expert Review, Agency Enablement.

Rules to keep it coherent

No subscription → no project (method always runs on the product).

All delivery in‑product (briefs, approvals, evidence); no off‑platform tools.

Method and usage data are structured for benchmarks; client‑specific outputs stay theirs.

B) IP plan (methods + tools + data)

1. Classify everything (and keep it that way)

BN Core IP: Radar code, schemas, Play Cards library, Literacy Ladder, Scorecards, benchmarks.

Embedded BN IP: BN Core embedded in client deliverables (licensed back to client for internal use).

Client‑Specific IP: Custom content/data created for a client (they own).

2. Contracts (put this in your MSA/IP Addendum)

License to client: non‑exclusive, non‑transferable, internal‑use rights to Embedded BN IP; no sub‑license, no derivative products.

BN retains rights to underlying systems, frameworks, prompts, schemas, and methods, and to reuse de‑identified learning.

Benchmarks: opt‑in, anonymous, aggregated; client cannot claim exclusivity.

3. Brand assets to protect (trademark names)

“BN Trust OS”, “AI Risk & Trust Radar”, “BN Literacy Ladder”, “Play Cards”.

Consider “Radar for Boards” and “Comms Governance Benchmarks”.

4. Data governance

Event‑sourced audit log; per‑tenant segregation; anonymisation pipeline + consent posture documented.

Publish a short Data Moat Policy (what’s collected, how it’s anonymised, how it powers benchmarks).

C) Format & repository architecture (single source of truth)

1. Docs‑as‑code repo (GitHub): bn-trust-os

Use Markdown/MDX with YAML front‑matter; PRs = reviews; Releases = versioned drops.

2. Front door (Notion or Confluence)

Mirror the repo structure with a simple nav:

Start Here → Strategy House (1‑pager)

Product → PRD / Roadmap / Release Notes

Method → Literacy Ladder / Play Cards (index)

Data → Benchmarks & KPI glossary

Trust Pack → Security & Legal

Sales/CS → Offers, Playbooks, Case Studies

Link each Notion page to the source file in GitHub to avoid “two sources of truth.”

3. Client workspace pattern

A client‑specific folder (or Notion space) that only contains Client‑Specific IP; link back to the shared method/product docs—do not copy them.

D) Standard templates (so every artifact looks the same)

1. Play Card (Markdown with YAML front‑matter)

# AI‑Guided Search (L1 · Discovery)

**Business outcome:** Reduce short‑list time by 30–40% and increase candidate relevance.

**Where it runs:** Radar → Briefs & Discovery (prompt library + results capture).

**Setup (week 1–2):**

1. Load brand guardrails & red‑flags.
2. Upload prompt kits.
3. Connect listening CSV export.

**Process:** …  
**Controls & risks:** …  
**Integrations:** CSV/webhook in; brief export; QBR pack out.

2. PRD page (trimmed)

Problem, Goals (with acceptance criteria), Out‑of‑Scope, Users & Jobs, Entity model, Flows, Instrumentation, Security/Privacy, Release plan, Risks.

3. QBR pack (auto‑generated from Radar)

Executive summary, Coverage %, TTFA trend, Exceptions (opened/cleared), Approvals SLA, Heat Map progress by tile, Next‑tile recommendation.

4. 12‑Week Literacy Sprint

Week‑by‑week syllabus, Scorecard checkpoints (baseline, week‑6, week‑12), unlock criteria for L2/L3.

E) Release & versioning

SemVer for methods, too. When a Play Card changes, bump minor/patch and note in CHANGELOG.md.

Monthly “Trust OS” release (tag): release notes summarise product, method, data changes.

Status tags for every artifact: Draft → In review → Approved → Superseded.

Owners named in front‑matter; PR review required from Product + Legal for anything that touches governance or IP.

F) Operating cadence (who meets when)

Weekly Product Council: adoption dashboard, top blockers, yes/no on generalisable features.

Weekly CS/GTM Sync: Play Cards in flight, QBR prep, renewal risk.

Monthly Release Review: publish “Trust OS rYYYY.MM” notes; update Notion links.

Quarterly Strategy Review: benchmarks & roadmap; pricing/packaging check.

G) 90‑day execution plan (do this now)

Days 1–10

Create bn-trust-os repo and import current Strategy, PRD, Literacy Ladder.

Approve the Play Card template and publish v1 for 5 L1 tiles.

Switch all new SOWs to the new MSA + IP Addendum; add the Method License clause.

Days 11–30

Wire the QBR pack export from Radar; retire manual decks.

Kick off 12‑Week Literacy Sprint with Personal AI Scorecards (baseline).

Create Data Moat Policy; list sub‑processors; start SOC2 gap log.

Days 31–60

Publish Benchmark Method and KPI glossary.

Add two L2 Play Cards (Discovery Bots, Compliance Bots) and name Tool‑makers in pilot accounts.

Run your first monthly “Trust OS” release; tag v2025.09.

Days 61–90

First Benchmarks v1 cut across pilots; launch “Radar for Boards” one‑pager.

Partner adapter specs (CSV/webhooks) finalised; first co‑marketing outline.

Conduct mock diligence on IP & Security folders; close gaps.

H) A short licensing snippet you can drop into the IP Addendum

BN Method & Play Card License. Brilliant Noise grants Client a non‑exclusive, non‑transferable, revocable license to use BN’s proprietary methods, frameworks, Play Cards, templates, schemas, and training materials (“BN Core IP”) solely for Client’s internal business purposes during the Term. No rights are granted to modify, translate, create derivative works based on, sub‑license, distribute, or commercialise BN Core IP. BN retains all right, title, and interest in BN Core IP and in any de‑identified learnings and benchmarks. Client retains ownership of Client‑Specific Deliverables distinct from BN Core IP.

(Adjust with counsel to your jurisdiction.)

I) How this makes sense to a buyer (and to your team)

One system: Product + Method + Data + Trust Pack, version‑controlled and shipped monthly.

One story: Literacy unlocks capability; Radar proves it; benchmarks price it; QBRs renew it.

One diligence path: Repo + Notion front door maps cleanly to the data room.
