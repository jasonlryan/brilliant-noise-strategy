# Performance Tracking (L1 · Measurement)

**Business outcome:** Transform performance reporting from weekly manual effort to real-time automated insights, reducing reporting time by 85%.

**Where it runs:** Radar → Performance Dashboard (automated tracking + AI insights).

**Foundation:** Requires Gate A green status for deployment.

## Setup (Week 1–2)

1. **Connect data sources**
   - Social platform APIs (Meta, LinkedIn, X, TikTok)
   - Web analytics (GA4, Adobe Analytics)
   - Campaign management platforms
   - CRM and sales data

2. **Configure KPI framework**
   - Map business objectives to measurable outcomes
   - Set up metric hierarchies (leading/lagging indicators)
   - Define benchmark targets and thresholds

3. **Design dashboard views**
   - Executive summary dashboard
   - Channel-specific deep dives
   - Campaign performance trackers
   - Anomaly detection alerts

## Process

### Week 1: Data Architecture
- Audit all data sources and access permissions
- Map data schemas and relationships
- Establish data quality baselines

### Week 2-3: Dashboard Build
- Create automated data pipelines
- Build visualization templates
- Set up AI insight generation

### Week 4+: Optimization
- Daily: Automated performance snapshots
- Weekly: AI-generated insight reports
- Monthly: Strategic performance reviews

## Controls & Risks

### Primary Controls
- **Data validation**: Automated accuracy checks against source systems
- **Access control**: Role-based dashboard permissions
- **Change tracking**: Version control for all metric definitions

### Key Risks
- **Data discrepancies**: Platform API changes → Daily validation
- **Metric gaming**: Optimizing for wrong KPIs → Balanced scorecards
- **Analysis paralysis**: Too many metrics → Focus on vital few

### Exception Handling
- Data sync failures → Fallback to manual import
- Anomaly detected → Automated investigation workflow
- Missing benchmarks → Industry standard substitution

## Integrations

### Inputs
- **Native APIs**: All major social and digital platforms
- **File imports**: CSV uploads for offline data
- **Webhooks**: Real-time campaign triggers
- **Database connections**: Direct SQL access where available

### Outputs
- **Executive reports**: PDF/PPT automated generation
- **Live dashboards**: Web-based interactive views
- **Data exports**: Excel/CSV for further analysis
- **Alert systems**: Email/Slack notifications

## Success Metrics

1. **Efficiency Gains**
   - Baseline: 8 hours weekly reporting effort
   - Target: < 1 hour (87.5% reduction)
   - Measurement: Time tracking analysis

2. **Data Quality**
   - Target: > 98% data accuracy
   - < 2% missing data points
   - Measurement: Automated quality scores

3. **Insight Value**
   - > 80% insight depth score
   - 5+ actionable insights per report
   - Measurement: Stakeholder feedback surveys

## Measurement Framework

### Core Metrics
- **Reach & Frequency**: Audience size, impression share, optimal frequency
- **Engagement**: Rates by content type, sentiment analysis, share of voice
- **Conversion**: Attribution modeling, customer journey mapping, ROI/ROAS
- **Brand Health**: Awareness, consideration, preference, NPS trends

### Advanced Analytics
- **Cohort Analysis**: Audience segment performance over time
- **Attribution Modeling**: Multi-touch and data-driven attribution
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Share of voice, engagement benchmarks
- **Predictive Indicators**: Early warning systems for performance dips

### Reporting Cadence
- **Real-time**: Campaign launch monitoring, crisis tracking
- **Daily**: Performance snapshots, anomaly alerts
- **Weekly**: Deep-dive analysis, optimization recommendations
- **Monthly**: Strategic review, QBR preparation

## Expansion Path

After 3 months of stable KPI achievement:
- Unlock L2 "Predictive Performance" with ML forecasting
