# Content Generation (L1 · Creation)

**Business outcome:** Accelerate content creation by 60% while maintaining brand consistency through AI-assisted drafting and editing.

**Where it runs:** Radar → Content Studio (guided generation + brand controls).

## Setup (Week 1–2)

1. **Configure brand voice**
   - Import brand guidelines, tone of voice documentation

   - Set up style parameters and guardrails

2. **Define content templates**
   - Social posts (platform-specific)
   - Blog articles and thought leadership
   - Email campaigns and newsletters
   - Press releases and media statements

3. **Establish approval workflows**
