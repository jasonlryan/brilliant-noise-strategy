# BN Trust OS Benchmark Method v1.0

## Overview

The BN Trust OS Benchmark Method provides the definitive framework for measuring, comparing, and improving AI governance in communications. This methodology powers the industry's first comprehensive benchmarking program for AI-assisted communications governance.

## Benchmark Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Anonymized Aggregation**: All client data is de-identified before analysis
2. **Opt-in Participation**: Clients voluntarily contribute to benchmarks
3. **Mutual Value**: Participants receive enhanced insights and industry position
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Benchmarks evolve with industry best practices

### Value Proposition
- **For Participants**: Understand competitive position and identify improvement opportunities
- **For Industry**: Establish governance maturity standards and best practices
- **For BN**: Demonstrate Trust OS value and inform product development

## Benchmark Framework

### Coverage Metrics

- 50th percentile: 8 days
- 25th percentile: 14 days

### Exception Rates
**Definition**: Frequency of governance process exceptions requiring escalation

| Exception Type | Calculation | Good/Acceptable/Poor |
|----------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Process Exceptions** | (Process deviations ÷ Total initiatives) × 100 | <2% / 2-5% / >5% |
| **Compliance Exceptions** | (Compliance issues ÷ Total approvals) × 100 | <1% / 1-3% / >3% |
| **Data Quality Exceptions** | (Data issues ÷ Total data points) × 100 | <0.5% / 0.5-2% / >2% |

### Approval SLA Performance
**Definition**: Percentage of approvals meeting defined service level agreements

| SLA Tier | Definition | Target | Measurement |
|----------|------------|---------|-------------|
| **Critical** | High-risk approvals | 95% within SLA | Real-time tracking |
| **Standard** | Routine approvals | 90% within SLA | Daily reports |
| **Bulk** | Automated approvals | 98% within SLA | System metrics |

### Literacy Progression
**Definition**: User competency advancement through BN Literacy Ladder

| Stage | Definition | Success Criteria |
|-------|------------|------------------|
| **L0 → L1** | Basic to Competent | 70% scorecard achievement |
| **L1 → L2** | Competent to Advanced | 3+ successful tile implementations |
| **L2 → L3** | Advanced to Expert | Tool-maker certification |

## Data Collection Method

### Automated Data Sources
1. **Radar Platform Analytics**
   - Initiative volume and types
   - Approval workflows and timing
   - Exception tracking
   - User behavior patterns

2. **System Integration Logs**
   - API usage statistics
   - Data sync performance
   - Error rates and resolution

3. **Training Platform Data**
   - Scorecard completions
   - Certification achievements
   - Learning progression

### Manual Data Sources
1. **Quarterly Client Surveys**
   - Satisfaction metrics
   - Perceived value
