# Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Policy

## Policy Summary
All code changes must follow the dev→staging→production workflow. Direct-to-production deployments are prohibited and automatically blocked. This ensures systematic change control and reduces operational risk.

**Effective Date:** [Date]  
**Review Frequency:** Monthly  
**Owner:** Engineering Lead

## Core SDLC Principles

### No Direct-to-Production Rule
- **Zero Direct Commits:** No code changes directly to production environment
- **Technical Enforcement:** Git branch protection prevents direct commits
- **Manual Override:** Requires CEO approval + documented emergency justification
- **Compliance Target:** 0 direct-to-prod events per month

### Three-Stage Workflow
**Development Environment:**
- Individual developer feature branches
- Local testing and initial validation
- No customer data access
- Continuous integration on commit

**Staging Environment:**  
- Production mirror for testing
- Integration testing and QA validation
- Performance and security testing
- Customer Success preview capability

**Production Environment:**
- Live customer data and operations
- Manual approval gate before deployment
- Automated rollback capability
- Real-time monitoring and alerting

## Development Workflow

### Feature Development
1. **Branch Creation:** Feature branch from main/develop
2. **Development:** Code changes with local testing
3. **Code Review:** Peer review required before merge
4. **Automated Testing:** CI pipeline runs all tests
5. **Merge Approval:** Engineering Lead approval for significant changes

### Code Review Requirements
**All Changes Require:**
- Technical review by senior developer
- Security review for authentication/authorization changes
- Documentation updates for external-facing changes
- Test coverage maintained or improved

**Review Criteria:**
- Code quality and maintainability
- Security best practices followed
- Performance impact considered
- Error handling and logging adequate

### Automated Testing
**Required Test Types:**
- Unit tests (80% coverage minimum)
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Security scans for common vulnerabilities
- Performance tests for critical paths

**CI Pipeline Steps:**
1. Code quality analysis (SonarQube, etc.)
2. Security vulnerability scanning
3. Automated test suite execution
4. Build and packaging validation
5. Staging deployment preparation

## Staging Deployment

### Staging Environment Requirements
- **Mirror Production:** Same configuration and data volume
- **Customer Data:** Anonymized/synthetic data only
- **Access Control:** Development and QA teams only
- **Testing Duration:** Minimum 24 hours for significant changes

### Pre-Production Testing
**Functional Testing:**
- Feature functionality validation
- Integration point testing
- User interface/experience validation
- Business logic verification

**Non-Functional Testing:**
- Performance under load
- Security vulnerability assessment
- Data integrity and backup testing
- Disaster recovery validation

**User Acceptance Testing:**
- Customer Success team validation
- Business stakeholder sign-off
- Documentation and training material review
- Support team readiness confirmation

## Production Deployment

### Manual Approval Gate
**Required Approvals:**
- Engineering Lead technical sign-off
- Security Lead approval for security-related changes
- CEO approval for major releases or emergency changes
- Customer Success approval for customer-facing changes

**Approval Criteria:**
- All staging tests passed
- Security review completed
- Rollback plan validated
- Communication plan ready

### Deployment Process
1. **Pre-Deployment:** Final production backup
2. **Deployment Window:** During agreed maintenance window
3. **Smoke Testing:** Critical path validation
4. **Monitoring:** Enhanced monitoring for 24 hours
5. **Rollback Ready:** Ability to revert within 15 minutes

### Post-Deployment Validation
- Application health checks pass
- Performance metrics within normal ranges
- Error rates below baseline thresholds
- Customer Success confirms normal operations

## Change Control

### Change Categories
**Standard Changes:**
- Bug fixes and minor enhancements
- Configuration updates
- Documentation changes
- Routine maintenance

**Significant Changes:**
- New features or capabilities
- Database schema modifications
- Security policy changes
- Integration modifications

**Emergency Changes:**
- Critical security patches
- Service-affecting bug fixes
- Data integrity issues
- Customer-impacting problems

### Change Documentation
**Required for All Changes:**
- Change description and business justification
- Technical implementation details
- Testing approach and results
- Rollback plan and procedures
- Communication and notification plan

## Security Integration

### Security Reviews
**Automatic Triggers:**
- Authentication or authorization changes
- Data handling modifications
- External API integrations
- Configuration changes

**Review Process:**
- Automated security scanning in CI pipeline
- Manual review by Security Lead for flagged changes
- Penetration testing for major security updates
- Compliance validation for regulated features

### Secure Coding Practices
**Required Standards:**
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure authentication and session management
- Proper error handling without information leakage
- Encryption for sensitive data in transit and at rest

## Emergency Procedures

### Emergency Deployment
**Triggers:**
- Critical security vulnerability
- Data integrity threat
- Service unavailability
- Customer data exposure risk

**Emergency Process:**
1. CEO approval for emergency bypass
2. Security Lead notification within 1 hour
3. Minimal testing in staging (time permitting)
4. Production deployment with enhanced monitoring
5. Post-incident review and process improvement

### Rollback Procedures
**Automatic Rollback Triggers:**
- Error rate exceeds 2x baseline
- Response time increases >50%
- Critical functionality failure
- Security alert activation

**Rollback Process:**
1. Automatic or manual trigger activation
2. Previous version restoration
3. Database rollback if necessary
4. Service health validation
5. Incident documentation and analysis

## Compliance & Monitoring

### SDLC Metrics
- **Direct-to-Prod Events:** Target 0 per month
- **Code Review Coverage:** Target 100%
- **Test Coverage:** Maintain >80%
- **Staging Time:** Minimum 24 hours per significant change

### Gate A Compliance
**Required Evidence:**
- Git branch protection screenshots
- CI/CD pipeline configuration documentation
- Monthly direct-to-prod event report (should be 0)
- Rollback test results from staging

### Continuous Improvement
- Monthly SDLC process review
- Developer feedback on workflow efficiency
- Tool evaluation and enhancement
- Industry best practice integration
