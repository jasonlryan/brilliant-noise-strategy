# Foundation Program Charter

## Program Overview
The Foundation program implements "Fortify the Foundation" controls that make BN Trust OS acquisition-ready by demonstrating systematic risk management and operational maturity.

**Duration:** 14 days implementation + ongoing governance

## Risk Management

### High Risks

**Mitigation:** Emphasize acquisition value, keep processes minimal

**Risk:** Gate A blocks important customer work  
**Mitigation:** Amber status allows work with risk acceptance

**Risk:** Implementation delays customer commitments  
**Mitigation:** Existing work continues, new work gets Foundation benefits

### Medium Risks
**Risk:** Legal framework updates slow down sales  
**Mitigation:** Grandfathering existing clients, new framework for new clients

**Risk:** Technical controls break existing workflows  
**Mitigation:** Implement gradually with fallback options

### Acquisition Communications
**Investment Materials:** Foundation as governance maturity proof  
**Due Diligence:** Foundation evidence repository ready  
**Buyer Meetings:** Foundation as competitive differentiator

## Budget & Resources
**Implementation:** 40 person-hours across 4 team members over 14 days  
**Ongoing:** 3 person-hours per week for maintenance and reviews  
**External Costs:** None (internal resources only)
