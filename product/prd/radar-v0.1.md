# AI Risk & Trust Radar v0.1 - Product Requirements Document

## Problem Statement

Communications teams are rapidly adopting AI tools without adequate governance frameworks, creating significant risks around compliance, brand safety, and operational accountability. Organizations need a systematic approach to manage AI-assisted communications while maintaining efficiency and competitive advantage.

**Core Problems:**
- No centralized visibility into AI tool usage across communications
- Manual governance processes that slow down campaign execution
- Lack of standardized risk assessment for AI-powered content
- Inability to demonstrate compliance to boards and regulators
- Missing benchmarks for measuring AI governance maturity

## Goals & Success Criteria

### Primary Goals
1. **Governance Automation**: Reduce manual governance overhead by 60% while maintaining compliance standards
2. **Risk Visibility**: Provide real-time visibility into AI usage and associated risks across all communications
3. **Process Standardization**: Establish repeatable workflows for AI initiative approval and monitoring
4. **Compliance Readiness**: Generate audit-ready documentation for regulatory and board requirements

### Success Criteria
- **Efficiency**: Time to First Approval (TTFA) â‰¤ 7 days for standard initiatives
- **Coverage**: 100% of AI initiatives tracked and governed within 90 days
- **Quality**: Exception rate < 5% for routine approvals
- **Adoption**: 85% of eligible users actively using the platform within 6 months

### Out of Scope - v0.1
- Multi-tenant architecture (single organization focus)
- Real-time content monitoring (post-publication only)
- Advanced ML/AI model integration (rule-based workflows only)
- White-label/partner portal functionality

## Core User Flows

### Flow 1: Initiative Registration
1. User accesses Radar dashboard
2. Selects "Register New AI Initiative" 
3. Completes initiative brief form with:
   - AI tool/platform details
   - Use case and business justification  
   - Risk assessment questionnaire
   - Stakeholder assignments
4. System auto-assigns priority and routing
5. Initiative enters approval workflow
6. User receives confirmation and tracking ID

### Flow 2: Approval Workflow
1. Initiative routed to appropriate approvers based on risk score
2. Approvers review initiative details and risk assessment
3. Approvers can:
   - Approve (moves to next stage)
   - Reject (returns to submitter with feedback)
   - Escalate (routes to senior approval level)
   - Request more information (notification to submitter)
4. System tracks approval SLAs and sends alerts
5. Final approval triggers documentation package creation

### Flow 3: Exception Handling
1. System or user identifies governance exception
2. Exception logged with severity classification
3. Appropriate stakeholders notified automatically
4. Exception assigned to responsible team member
5. Resolution workflow initiated with tracking
6. Closure requires evidence and sign-off

### Flow 4: QBR Report Generation
1. User selects reporting period and scope
2. System aggregates metrics and benchmarks
3. AI generates executive summary and insights
4. User reviews and customizes report
5. Final report exported in multiple formats
6. Report archived for audit purposes
