# BN Trust OS Strategy House

## Positioning

**External one-liner:**
BN Trust OS is the governance spine for AI-assisted communications—combining a SaaS platform (Radar), a proven transformation method (Literacy Ladder + Play Cards), benchmark data for boards, and a built-in Foundation layer (IP + Security + SDLC) that makes it safe, repeatable, and acquisition-ready.

## Strategic Rules

### Rule 1: Product-Led Growth
**No subscription → no project** (method always runs on the product)

### Rule 2: Platform-Native Delivery
**All delivery in-product** (briefs, approvals, evidence); no off-platform tools

### Rule 3: Data Moat Protection
**Method and usage data** are structured for benchmarks; client-specific outputs stay theirs

### Rule 4: Foundation Gate Control
**No tier activation until Gate A is green** - Foundation controls must pass before any customer-facing work begins
