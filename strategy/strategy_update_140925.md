Strategy for Brilliant Noise (BN)
From Literacy-Led to Product-Attached Growth

1. Current Reality
   BN is currently best known for AI literacy and adoption enablement (AI-B-C digital, workshops, frameworks, C-suite training). This brand equity is strong and aligns with Article 4 of the EU AI Act, which makes AI literacy a compliance requirement from February 2025 onward [1].

For clarity: Article 4 mandates that providers and deployers of AI systems ensure that their staff and other persons dealing with the operation and use of AI systems have a sufficient level of AI literacy, tailored to their roles and responsibilities.
BN has delivered training to ~250 senior leaders, giving it deep C-suite trust and a proprietary network of decision-makers.

Today’s buyer perception: BN = literacy & advisory, not product.

AI Divide
95% of enterprise AI pilots fail; only 5% reach production with measurable P&L impact. Mid-market firms scale in 90 days; enterprises take 9 months.

Pilot-to-Production Velocity
Company Size Avg. Time to Full Implementation Success Rate
Mid-Market ~90 Days -
Large Enterprise ~9+ Months ~5%
Barriers to Scale
The primary reasons pilots fail are not technical but human-centric, rooted in user adoption and concerns about output quality without proper context.

Top Barriers to Scaling AI (Frequency Score /10)
Unwillingness to adopt
9.1
Output quality concerns
7.8
Poor user experience
7.2
Shadow AI
~90% of employees use consumer AI, but only ~40% of companies buy enterprise licenses—power users are already literate. This usage is concentrated on specific tasks.

Buy vs Build Success

ROI Lives in Back Office
BPO elimination and agency spend cuts drive the clearest returns.

Selection Criteria
Buyers choose vendors on trust, workflow fit, and the ability to improve over time.

If BN launches both a beachhead product (AI Risk & Trust Radar) and broad adoption frameworks at once, the GTM (Go-to-Market) risks confusion:

Is BN selling software, training, or transformation?
Does the first ask look like a consulting engagement or a SaaS subscription? 4) Strategy – Literacy-Led, Product-Attached, Outcome-Proof
Phase 1 – Land with Compliance Literacy (30 days)
Package BN’s strength into an “Article 4 AI Literacy Sprint.” Deliver training + role-based literacy + a Board Pack proving compliance.
Always attach a Governance Memory mini-portal (tracks attendance, policies, attestations). This is the seed of Radar Core.
Phase 2 – Governed Adoption (90 days)
From literacy cohorts, identify shadow AI champions.
Pilot one workflow with guardrails (Support Ops or Document Ops) using the mini-portal as evidence. Low setup, visible value, and KPIs: cycle time, incident reduction, external spend.
Publish updated Board Pack with KPI deltas.
Phase 3 – Benchmarks & Expansion (6–12 months)
Add Comms Maturity Benchmark and Incident Playbooks as portal modules.
Show ROI via reduced agency/BPO spend and measurable improvements.
Introduce Transform advisory (e.g., crisis simulations) only after expansion. 5) ICP (UK/EU)
Firmographics: £100m–£2bn revenue; 200–4,000 FTE. Sectors: Professional Services, Retail/e‑com, FS-ops, Media.
Triggers: Compliance deadline, High agency/BPO spend (≥£750k), Shadow AI adoption, Upcoming high-stakes campaigns.
Politics: Preference for partner channels, incumbent bias, demand for low disruption and data boundaries. 6) Channels & Routes to Market
Legal/risk boutiques and PR/comms suites.
Microsoft/ServiceNow ecosystem partners.
Board/peer referrals from BN’s C-suite alumni.
BN Edition as a marketing engine. 7) Pricing & Commercials
Literacy Sprint: Fixed fee + org license for portal.
Governed Adoption: Pilot fee + outcome rider.
Expansion: Module add-ons + advisory retainer. 8) Operating Model
Appoint AI Success Managers with commercial KPIs.
Instrument telemetry in every sprint.
Publish anonymised benchmarks → build a data moat. 9) 180-Day Execution Plan
Day 0–30
Run 12 “Founding Member” Article 4 Literacy Sprints. Deploy Governance Memory. Deliver Board Packs.

Day 31–90
Pilot one workflow per client with guardrails. Measure before/after. Update Board Packs.

Day 91–180
Expand with Benchmark + Playbooks. Sign 12-month plans. Publish first Radar Index. Secure 2–3 partner channels.

10. Guardrails Against GTM Drift
    One ask per stage
    Literacy → Adoption → Expansion
    Align with buyer needs
    Reference 5 buyer criteria
    Show, don't tell
    Demonstrate embedded guardrails
    Focus on the right ROI
    External spend replaced, not headcount
